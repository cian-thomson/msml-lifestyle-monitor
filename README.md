## About

Lifestyle monitoring is an essential aspect of managing chronic health conditions and maintaining overall well-being. This project aims to design and implement a multi-modal sensor and machine learning-based system that collects and processes data from a wide array of sources, such as:

- RGB cameras
- Depth sensors
- Event cameras
- Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
- Mobile phone sensors
- Healthcare sensors

The system uses this data to identify and quantify physical activities, nutritional intake, and vital health parameters. Machine learning and computer vision techniques are employed to provide meaningful insights, with the end goal of building a prototype that can assist in healthcare-related lifestyle tracking.

This is a project by a team of MEng Electronic & Electrical Engineering students, supervised by Dr. Charith Abhayaratne and Dr. Kennedy Offor.
